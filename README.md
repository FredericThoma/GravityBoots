This GitLab repository contains the results of the GameLab I project Gravity Boots.
The objective of this project was to create a 2D-Platformer game that combines 
classic platformer elements with the challenging mechanic of gravity-manipulation.

In this repository you can find a playable version of the game.
Additionally a trailer as well as a poster, both of which aim to reflect the
content of the game in a visually appealing way, can be found. 
Finally, a paper that describes the development process of the game was written.
